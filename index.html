        Out of Their League

        <p>The Premier League’s level of spending reached dizzying new heights this winter. Emboldened by the prospect of a brand new television deal that brings in over $12 billion over the course of 3 years. Even so, on the back of a pandemic, this level of expenditure was unprecedented for a winter window, dwarfing every other league. </p>
​        <p>Chelsea led the charge this winter, on the back of a takeover by Clearlake Capital, a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali. Their spending on Mykhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez alone eclipsed what the Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga spent on players. This expenditure led the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas to claim that the Premier League was involved in “financial doping.” This comes on the back of spending by Newcastle and Tottenham, both of whom are vying for Champions League spots. An analysis of data scraped from Transfermarkt reveals that over the course of the last 20 years, the Premier League has consistently outspent La Liga.</p>
​
        <p>While La Liga has been the more successful league in terms of intercontinental success, they have been struggling to translate that into revenue. Take Barcelona for example, their lavish spending following Neymar’s exit put them in a deep economic spiral, which culminated in Lionel Messi’s tearful exit from the league in 2021. COVID put a temporary break on spending across the league, but the British league bounced back quite quickly. With Manchester United also up for sale, spending could go up as  new owners also typically tend to inject more cash into a league.</p>
        <p>New owners and managerial changes always affect expenditure. The lucrative revenues of the Premier League attracts many new investors who wish to build a brand, with countries often investing in these projects. </p>
